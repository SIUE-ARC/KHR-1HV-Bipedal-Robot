KHR-1HV Bipedal Robot files


--------------------------------
Short Term Goals
--------------------------------
1. Sniff the polulu's software and find out what command it sends to change the serial settings (Its not documentated and forces you to use there software) 

--------------------------------
Goals
--------------------------------

1. Create software that is moduler and easy to be re-used for the other bi-pedeal robots in the Lair
2. Put the KHR-1HV on ROS 
3. Document our findings so that anyone that wants to use it as a platform has a good set of resources and software to use
4. Have the KHR-1HV run off a Pi and do basic movements (walking,standing up, wave etc..)

--------------------------------
Extra Goals
--------------------------------
1. Implement ROS moveit 
2. Work with arduino or other common micro controllers
3. Find and implement another alternative to the maestro polulu server controller
